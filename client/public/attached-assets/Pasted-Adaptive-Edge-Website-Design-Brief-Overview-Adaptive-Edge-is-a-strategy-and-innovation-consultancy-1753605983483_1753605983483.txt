Adaptive Edge Website Design Brief

Overview

Adaptive Edge is a strategy and innovation consultancy that helps organisations and leaders thrive in uncertainty by unlocking collective intelligence, driving purposeful innovation, and building adaptive capacity. We blend systems thinking, design, facilitation, and AI to create strategies that teams feel true ownership of – increasing the likelihood of successful implementation.

The site should reflect this collaborative, forward-thinking, AI-native approach with a clean, minimal, and original design. It should feel engaging and human, with subtle animations to bring it to life without being overwhelming. The tone should be modern, smart, and approachable.

Goals for the Site
	1.	Present Adaptive Edge as a fresh, unique consultancy with a distinctive way of working.
	2.	Showcase our services, tools, and past work in a way that feels credible and differentiated.
	3.	Make it easy for potential clients to get in touch or start a conversation.
	4.	Convey that we are AI-native, collaborative, and deeply strategic.

⸻

Target Audience
	•	Senior leaders and decision-makers in ambitious, values-led organisations navigating complexity or change.
	•	Companies exploring strategy, innovation, or AI adoption.
	•	Prospects seeking a partner who works with them rather than presenting solutions in isolation.

⸻

Design Style
	•	Minimal, modern, and bold, with moments of playfulness through subtle animations or interactions.
	•	Typography: Preference for Helvetica/Neue Haas Grotesk for clarity, paired with a clean serif like Jansen or similar for headlines.
	•	Colour palette: Inspired by Adaptive Edge’s coral chameleon and navy brand colours. Use white space generously.
	•	Feel: Creative, refreshing, but trustworthy. It should stand apart from typical consultancy websites.

Key Messaging / Unique Approach

We don’t take the problem away and return with a PowerPoint. We co-create strategies with client teams, doing the heavy lifting while making them feel like creators of the strategy. Our interactive workshops use the “Ikea effect”, increasing ownership and implementation success.

We are also an AI-native consultancy – we leverage AI tools for deeper, broader research and interactive outputs that go beyond static deliverables.
